			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>I study in Amity International school Noida, I Like to play guitar and do drawing, I even Like to Code (Python)
                I am currently learning HTML , CSS and Javascript. I was born on 2nd June . I am currently in mumbai and I am going
                to shift in Noida . In drawing i like to make sketchs . I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, 
                I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. 
                I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, 
                I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the Eifel Tower in Paris . I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and adventerous movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
